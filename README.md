Fruit Shopping Cart

Threre are 2 test files .

1)OrderTest.java which is simple java class to test the application
2)JUnitTestOrder.java is Junit test class.

The Order class has 3 constructors which takes no-parameter, orderid as parameter and last one with orderid and corresponding collection of products (fruits).

I have given more functonlity apart from the actual requirements.
If you want to pass your own products, then either tweak the 2 test classes or call the Order constructor -  Order(String uid, Map<String, Product> map).
